The algorithm by which this program works: ""Pretend that you know everything; if suddenly user caught you in a lie and provides evidence - fall at his feet, beg for forgiveness."" 😃 Quotes are made up on the fly.

Do not download this app. They are data stolers. When i downloaded this app there was a pink colour small dot photo was showing in my gallary autometically. When i deleted it . It was coming back again and again. I took help from samsung customer care. They did many things to help but this did not get sorted out. After couple of hours it started coming again in my photos. I was like a virus. Then i deleted this app and then deleted that photo then it did not came back again. This is the worstapp,1,negative

In this case this app is not useful because it is not a reliable source as after only one response, it keeps saying server is busy due to which i can not interact with AI assistant and i cannot clear my queries. This need to be corrected by installing many GPUs but they have limited the GPUs and do not improve which makes openAI winner at least they don't say this",2,negative

DeepSeek has several limitations: 1. Data Dependency: Its accuracy depends on the quality and completeness of the data. 2. Contextual Challenges: Struggles with nuanced or highly contextual information. 3. Resource Intensive: Requires significant computational power. 4. Real-time Issues: May experience delays with large datasets or complex queries. 5. Complex Queries: May struggle with multi-step or highly complex queries. 6. Bias: Can reflect biases in training data. And many more!,1,neutral

Is DS providing reasoning in order to coax the user into a certain kind of understanding to appreciate the response that will follow, or is DS simply providing objective reasoning? This has to be clarified. Humans normally do not provide their reasoning before they respond because it causes complication in communication and trust, and so does DS's reasoning.

I think this app is wonderful. It's so sad though that other AI companies are cyberattacking their server. Which is why popped up and says server is busy sometimes. Even though that's the case I'm still sticking with deep seek Cause it's an awesome program 10 times cheaper. I can't wait for them to get a voice model function because I refuse to pay $200 for chatgpt unlimited. Keep it up guys!,5,positive

"DeepSeek has potential, but it falls short in a few key areas. Compared to GPT, it feels less intuitive and engaging. One major issue is that it doesn’t reference previous chat history, so every response feels like starting from scratch. This makes conversations feel disconnected and less natural. Additionally, the responses are often overly detailed, which can be overwhelming, and it lacks real-time information, making it less useful for up. PS. DeepSeek wrote this for me.",3,negative

"Top Coding App—Fix RTL Mixing! Deep Seek’s HTML editor + live execution is stellar for prototyping. Syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and previews streamline coding.

"The quality and format of the responses are half-decent to me (I've had almost no experience with other ChatGPT-like services, so I haven't made any comparisons), but apparently there's a fairly significant hardware capacity issue amid DeepSeek's media hype, as it probably just can't cope with the influx of users: the service is constantly underdelivering answers due to overloading. Until this problem is resolved (if at all), I can give it only 3 stars at best, since it's really quite hindering",3,negative

I've created templates that are chosen by a prompt - when providing the prompt, the template is generated however additional text is also provided making it unable to be copy and pasted. Even after instructing not to add additional text, it still does it. Will stick with chatgpt paying my $30aud a month.",3,negative

"I installed this before it hit the headlines and it was working brilliantly, really impressed. However, since it was featured in the news I'm getting nothing from it.

Then it says 'generating' followed by another blank reply. I guess it can't handle the traffic any more.",1,negative

Keep in mind everything you input and get as output goes to a China server and they hold the data you input even if you delete your account.

"DeepSeek-V3 is a helpful and intelligent assistant, but the lack of a memory feature is a significant drawback. It would be great if the app could remember past interactions or preferences to provide more personalized and continuous support. Without this, it feels like starting over in every session. I’m giving it 4 stars because the core functionality is good, but this missing feature limits its potential. Hoping the developers can add this in future updates!",4,neutral

"Look, it's new, nice, and all, but it still lacks basic features that are important to me. Recording chat would be the first. Then, I'd say the inability to remember chat history in the same thread puts it far behind its competitors. I am not a technical person, so my feedback is purely user-based. But I'll keep checking in periodically for updates and hoping these issues will change in the future.",3,negative

"“Server busy” – Deep Sick’s anthem. Every. Single. Time. Need answers? Too bad. Photo generation? A fairy tale. Why force Google Play Store enablement if the app still can’t function? Reinstalling? A ritual of hopelessness. Even this review was written by Deep Sick (yes, really) – this is the 20th attempt that finally “succeeded.” The app crashed, froze, then decided to mock itself by drafting this dumpster fire. Congrats, devs – your app’s sole talent is being a self-sabotaging punchline.",2,negative

It started strong but failed quick. I attempted to use it a automated D.M for a D&D style experience. It worked better then ChatGPT.

The app also struggles with Bangla sentence formation, making frequent errors. Additionally, it takes too long to deliver results, which hampers user experience. While the concept is good, these problems make it hard to rely on the app. Fixing these issues could greatly improve usability and reliability. Rating: 3/5",3,negative

I tried to chat with your AI but couldn't because server were busy. I tried many times but still servers busy message. But there is ap problem with the pointer(which identifies what and where youre typing) when you type/enter the prompt. When you hit space bar after typing a word and start typing another word then the pointer starts overlapping the newest letter of the word. I hope you'll work on the servers and on that pointer too because that makes UX little low.,3,negative

There are so many fake reviews on here. It doesn't do half of the things people say it does. Many people are comparing it to Nvidia's AI offering! They manufacturer chips for AI industry and don't have their own app! It looks like there are a lot of people on here just trying to affect Nvidia's share price. So limited in what it can do. This has got so far to go before you even get near open AI or Gemini. Don't bother at the moment people.,1,negative

"1. **Improve the responsiveness of the ""Enter"" button** (it’s slow to react). 2. **Add animations** to make the interface more visually appealing. 3. **Increase the font size** for better readability. 4. **Enhance the overall interface design** to make it less ""normal and decent"" and more vibrant/engaging.

"This is the first reasoning model that is capable of searching the web for the latest information. OpenAI can't do that with their state-of-the-art models yet. Also, it's free, unlimited, and open source. With open AI you would have to pay $200 for the same thing. It's the future because it uses a more advanced training model, and can thus achieve the same results with much less compute It still needs a memory function, both persistent and contextual. As well as a search and organizing folders.",5,neutral

Also, the Restrictive Filter of guidelines and respect is too restrictive and won't let you generate Text incñuding things that are minimally Vulgar or out of place for a 10 years old boy, which makes no sense, it is Over sensitive, and sometimes the prompt requires it for artistic or contextual purposes.",1,negative

1: Add 'Pin Chat' for Better Chat Organization It would be super helpful to pin important chats to the top of the list so they are always easy to find. Maybe add a little pin icon to make them stand out and let us unpin or rearrange them as needed. It would save a ton of time and keep things organized Just a thought. 2: Another idea: 'Follow-Up Question' feature could be super handy it would let users ask related questions in the same chat thread keeping the context intact.,5,positive

"Literally the best free LLM rn! I've tested this for coding tasks, content creation and technical troubleshooting and it's even better than gpt 4/4o mini in most cases. Most importantly, it's free! The only minor issue that I face sometimes is with the file attachment feature. It sometimes fails to scan an image, but I hope DeepSeek team will soon fix it. And maybe they even add more attachments options in the future.",5,positive
"I love your work guys, doing an immense favor for humanity as a whole! 🤟",5,positive

Definately the best one. But please add voice input option too it is too much handy to miss out on Damnnnn what a smooth ux it hasss... Sassyy...,5,positive
"DeepSeek AI is outstanding in its seamless code execution and produces text responses that surpass those of Google Gemini. Its outputs are notably nuanced and context-aware, often rivaling or even exceeding those of ChatGPT. However, the absence of robust language support could enhance its appeal to a global user base. Nonetheless, DeepSeek AI emerges as a powerful and reliable tool that distinguishes itself in the competitive market.",5,positive
